# 2025-Domain-adaptive-semi-supervised-learning-for-efficient-rare-pathological-lesion-detection

This repository contains code used in the paper "Domain-adaptive semi-supervised learning for efficient rare pathological lesion detection with minimal annotation." 
The repository includes code for image preparation, YOLO training, pseudo-label generation for semi-supervised learning, and residual CycleGAN-related implementations. 
All code is designed to be executed in Jupyter Notebook.
